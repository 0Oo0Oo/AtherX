# Form Check Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Form Check feature uses AI-powered pose tracking to analyze workout form in real-time using video recordings. Users can record their workouts and receive detailed feedback on their form and technique.

## Features

### üé• Video Recording

- **Real-time camera access** with front/back camera toggle
- **30-second maximum recording** to ensure manageable file sizes
- **Recording timer** with visual indicators
- **Video preview** before analysis

### ü§ñ AI Form Analysis

- **Exercise-specific analysis** for different workout types
- **Pose tracking technology** using PoseTracker API
- **Real-time feedback** on form issues
- **Scoring system** (0-100) for overall form quality

### üìä Detailed Results

- **Overall form score** with color-coded feedback
- **Strengths identification** - what the user did well
- **Areas for improvement** with specific corrections
- **Joint-by-joint analysis** with severity levels
- **Timestamp-based feedback** showing when issues occurred

## How to Use

### 1. Select Exercise

- Tap the exercise selector at the top of the screen
- Choose from the exercise library (Squats, Bench Press, Deadlift, etc.)
- The AI will analyze based on the selected exercise type

### 2. Record Your Workout

- Position yourself so your full body is visible in the frame
- Tap the red "RECORD" button to start recording
- Perform 3-5 reps of your chosen exercise
- Tap "STOP" when finished (or wait for auto-stop at 30 seconds)

### 3. Review and Analyze

- Preview your recorded video
- Tap "Analyze Form" to process with AI
- Wait for analysis (typically 2-3 seconds)
- Review your detailed results

### 4. Understand Your Results

#### Form Score

- **80-100**: Excellent form ‚≠ê
- **60-79**: Good form with minor improvements üëç
- **Below 60**: Needs improvement üí™

#### Feedback Categories

- **‚úÖ Strengths**: What you're doing correctly
- **üí° Improvements**: Specific areas to focus on
- **üîç Detailed Analysis**: Joint-by-joint breakdown with severity levels

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "expo-camera": "Camera access and video recording",
  "expo-av": "Video playback and preview",
  "expo-file-system": "File management for recorded videos"
}
```

### API Integration

The feature integrates with PoseTracker API for form analysis:

- **Endpoint**: `https://api.posetracker.com/v1/analyze`
- **Method**: POST with multipart/form-data
- **Payload**: Video file + exercise type + API key

### Demo Mode

For testing without API access, the app includes a demo mode that:

- Simulates 2-second processing time
- Generates realistic feedback based on exercise type
- Provides varied scores and specific joint feedback

## File Structure

```
screens/
  FormCheckScreen.js     # Main form check interface
services/
  PoseTrackerService.js  # API integration and analysis
App.js                   # Navigation setup
app.json                 # Permissions configuration
```

## Permissions Required

- **Camera**: To record workout videos
- **Microphone**: For audio in workout videos (optional)
- **Storage**: To temporarily store recorded videos

## Best Practices for Users

### Camera Setup

- Ensure good lighting for better analysis
- Position camera 6-8 feet away
- Keep full body in frame throughout exercise
- Use landscape orientation for better view

### Recording Tips

- Perform 3-5 clean reps for best analysis
- Move at normal workout pace (not too fast/slow)
- Ensure exercise is clearly visible from the side
- Avoid loose clothing that obscures movement

### Analysis Accuracy

- Results are most accurate for compound movements
- Side view typically provides best analysis
- Clear, unobstructed movement produces better feedback
- Multiple angles can be recorded for comparison

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time form checking during live workouts
- Progress tracking over time
- Custom exercise creation
- Social sharing of form improvements
- Integration with wearable devices
- Multiple camera angles support

## API Key Setup

To use with real PoseTracker API:

1. Sign up at PoseTracker.com
2. Get your API key
3. Replace 'demo-api-key-123' in FormCheckScreen.js
4. Update PoseTrackerService constructor

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Camera permission denied**: Check device settings
- **Video too large**: Ensure 30-second limit
- **Analysis failed**: Check internet connection
- **Poor results**: Improve lighting and camera position

### Error Handling

The app includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limiting
- Video file corruption
- Permission conflicts
- Low-quality recordings
